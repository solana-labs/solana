<a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction"><h1>Introduction</h1></a>
<p>This document defines the architecture of Solana, a blockchain built from the
ground up for scale. The goal of the architecture is to demonstrate there
exists a set of software algorithms that in combination, removes software as a
performance bottleneck, allowing transaction throughput to scale proportionally
with network bandwidth. The architecture goes on to satisfy all three desirable
properties of a proper blockchain, that it not only be scalable, but that it is
also secure and decentralized.</p>
<p>With this architecture, we calculate a theoretical upper bound of 710 thousand
transactions per second (tps) on a standard gigabit network and 28.4 million
tps on 40 gigabit. In practice, our focus has been on gigabit.  We soak-tested
a 150 node permissioned testnet and it is able to maintain a mean transaction
throughput of approximately 200 thousand tps with peaks over 400 thousand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have found high throughput extends beyond simple payments, and
that this architecture is also able to perform safe, concurrent execution of
programs authored in a general purpose programming language, such as C. We feel
the extension warrants industry focus on an additional performance metric
already common in the CPU industry, millions of <em>instructions</em> per second or
mips. By measuring mips, we see that batching instructions within a transaction
amortizes the cost of signature verification, lifting the maximum theoretical
instruction throughput up to almost exactly that of centralized databases.</p>
<p>Lastly, we discuss the relationships between high throughput, security and
transaction fees.  Solana's efficient use hardware drives transaction fees into
the ballpark of 1/1000th of a cent. The drop in fees in turn makes certain
denial of service attacks cheaper. We discuss what these attacks look like and
Solana's techniques to defend against them.</p>

<p>It's possible for a centralized database to process 710,000 transactions per
second on a standard gigabit network if the transactions are, on average, no
more than 176 bytes. A centralized database can also replicate itself and
maintain high availability without significantly compromising that transaction
rate using the distributed system technique known as Optimistic Concurrency
Control <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.65.4735">[H.T.Kung, J.T.Robinson
(1981)]</a>. At
Solana, we're demonstrating that these same theoretical limits apply just as
well to blockchain on an adversarial network. The key ingredient? Finding a way
to share time when nodes can't trust one-another. Once nodes can trust time,
suddenly ~40 years of distributed systems research becomes applicable to
blockchain!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most striking difference between algorithms obtained by our
method and ones based upon timeout is that using timeout produces a
traditional distributed algorithm in which the processes operate
asynchronously, while our method produces a globally synchronous one in which
every process does the same thing at (approximately) the same time. Our
method seems to contradict the whole purpose of distributed processing, which
is to permit different processes to operate independently and perform
different functions. However, if a distributed system is really a single
system, then the processes must be synchronized in some way. Conceptually,
the easiest way to synchronize processes is to get them all to do the same
thing at the same time. Therefore, our method is used to implement a kernel
that performs the necessary synchronization--for example, making sure that
two different processes do not try to modify a file at the same time.
Processes might spend only a small fraction of their time executing the
synchronizing kernel; the rest of the time, they can operate
independently--e.g., accessing different files. This is an approach we have
advocated even when fault-tolerance is not required. The method's basic
simplicity makes it easier to understand the precise properties of a system,
which is crucial if one is to know just how fault-tolerant the system is.

<p>A Verifiable Delay Function is conceptually a water clock where its water marks
can be recorded and later verified that the water most certainly passed
through.  Anatoly describes the water clock analogy in detail here:</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-explained-by-a-water-clock-e682183417b8">water clock analogy</a></p>
<p>The same technique has been used in Bitcoin since day one. The Bitcoin feature
is called nLocktime and it can be used to postdate transactions using block
height instead of a timestamp. As a Bitcoin client, you'd use block height
instead of a timestamp if you don't trust the network. Block height turns out
to be an instance of what's being called a Verifiable Delay Function in
cryptography circles. It's a cryptographically secure way to say time has
passed. In Solana, we use a far more granular verifiable delay function, a SHA
256 hash chain, to checkpoint the ledger and coordinate consensus. With it, we
implement Optimistic Concurrency Control and are now well en route towards that
theoretical limit of 710,000 transactions per second.</p>
<a class="header" href="#proof-of-history" id="proof-of-history"><h1>Proof of History</h1></a>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274">Proof of History overview</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#relationship-to-consensus-mechanisms" id="relationship-to-consensus-mechanisms"><h2>Relationship to consensus mechanisms</h2></a>
<p>Most confusingly, a Proof of History (PoH) is more similar to a Verifiable
Delay Function (VDF) than a Proof of Work or Proof of Stake consensus
mechanism. The name unfortunately requires some historical context to
understand. Proof of History was developed by Anatoly Yakovenko in November of
2017, roughly 6 months before we saw a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf">paper using the term
VDF</a>. At that time, it was commonplace to
publish new proofs of some desirable property used to build most any blockchain
component. Some time shortly after, the crypto community began charting out all
the different consensus mechanisms and because most of them started with &quot;Proof
of&quot;, the prefix became synonymous with a &quot;consensus&quot; suffix. Proof of History
is not a consensus mechanism, but it is used to improve the performance of
Solana's Proof of Stake consensus. It is also used to improve the performance
of the replication and storage protocols. To minimize confusion, Solana may
rebrand PoH to some flavor of the term VDF.</p>
<a class="header" href="#relationship-to-vdfs" id="relationship-to-vdfs"><h2>Relationship to VDFs</h2></a>
<p>A desirable property of a VDF is that verification time is very fast. Solana's
approach to verifying its delay function is proportional to the time it took to
create it. Split over a 4000 core GPU, it is sufficiently fast for Solana's
needs, but if you asked the authors the paper cited above, they might tell you
(and have) that Solana's approach is algorithmically slow it shouldn't be
called a VDF. We argue the term VDF should represent the category of verifiable
delay functions and not just the subset with certain performance
characteristics. Until that's resolved, Solana will likely continue using the
term PoH for its application-specific VDF.</p>
<p>Another difference between PoH and VDFs used only for tracking duration, is
that PoH's hash chain includes hashes of any data the application observed.
That data is a double-edged sword. On one side, the data &quot;proves history&quot; -
that the data most certainly existed before hashes after it. On the side, it
means the application can manipulate the hash chain by changing <em>when</em> the data
is hashed. The PoH chain therefore does not serve as a good source of
randomness whereas a VDF without that data could. Solana's leader selection
algorithm (TODO: add link), for example, is derived only from the VDF <em>height</em>
and not its hash at that height.</p>
<a class="header" href="#leader-rotation" id="leader-rotation"><h1>Leader Rotation</h1></a>
<p>A property of any permissionless blockchain is that the entity choosing the next block is randomly selected. In proof of stake systems,
that entity is typically called the &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;block producer.&quot; In Solana, we call it the leader. Under the hood, a leader is
simply a mode of the fullnode. A fullnode runs as either a leader or validator. In this chapter, we describe how a fullnode determines
what node is the leader, how that mechanism may choose different leaders at the same time, and if so, how the system converges in response.</p>
<a class="header" href="#leader-seed-generation" id="leader-seed-generation"><h2>Leader Seed Generation</h2></a>
<p>Leader selection is decided via a random seed.  The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Periodically, at a specific PoH tick count, select the signatures of the votes that made up the last supermajority</li>
<li>Concatenate the signatures</li>
<li>Hash the resulting string for <code>N</code> counts</li>
<li>The resulting hash is the random seed for <code>M</code> counts, <code>M</code> leader slots, where M &gt; N</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#leader-rotation-1" id="leader-rotation-1"><h2>Leader Rotation</h2></a>
<ol>
<li>The leader is chosen via a random seed generated from stake weights and votes (the leader schedule)</li>
<li>The leader is rotated every <code>T</code> PoH ticks (leader slot), according to the leader schedule</li>
<li>The schedule is applicable for <code>M</code> voting rounds</li>
</ol>
<p>Leader's transmit for a count of <code>T</code> PoH ticks.  When <code>T</code> is reached all the validators should switch to the next scheduled leader.  To schedule leaders, the supermajority + <code>M</code> nodes are shuffled using the above calculated random seed.</p>
<p>All <code>T</code> ticks must be observed from the current leader for that part of PoH to be accepted by the network.  If <code>T</code> ticks (and any intervening transactions) are not observed, the network optimistically fills in the <code>T</code> ticks, and continues with PoH from the next leader.</p>
<a class="header" href="#partitions-forks" id="partitions-forks"><h2>Partitions, Forks</h2></a>
<p>Forks can arise at PoH tick counts that correspond to leader rotations, because leader nodes may or may not have observed the previous leader's data.  These empty ticks are generated by all nodes in the network at a network-specified rate for hashes-per-tick <code>Z</code>.</p>
<p>There are only two possible versions of the PoH during a voting round: PoH with <code>T</code> ticks and entries generated by the current leader, or PoH with just ticks.  The &quot;just ticks&quot; version of the PoH can be thought of as a virtual ledger, one that all nodes in the network can derive from the last tick in the previous slot.</p>
<p>Validators can ignore forks at other points (e.g. from the wrong leader), or slash the leader responsible for the fork.</p>
<p>Validators vote on the longest chain that contains their previous vote, or a longer chain if the lockout on their previous vote has expired.</p>
<a class="header" href="#validators-view" id="validators-view"><h4>Validator's View</h4></a>
<a class="header" href="#time-progression" id="time-progression"><h5>Time Progression</h5></a>
<p>The diagram below represents a validator's view of the PoH stream with possible forks over time.  L1, L2, etc. are leader slots, and <code>E</code>s represent entries from that leader during that leader's slot.  The <code>x</code>s represent ticks only, and time flows downwards in the diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="Leader scheduler" src="img/leader-scheduler.svg" class="center"/></p>
<p>Note that an <code>E</code> appearing on 2 branches at the same slot is a slashable condition, so a validator observing <code>L3</code> and <code>L3'</code> can slash L3 and safely choose <code>x</code> for that slot.  Once a validator observes a supermajority vote on any branch, other branches can be discarded below that tick count.  For any slot, validators need only consider a single &quot;has entries&quot; chain or a &quot;ticks only&quot; chain.</p>
<a class="header" href="#time-division" id="time-division"><h5>Time Division</h5></a>
<p>It's useful to consider leader rotation over PoH tick count as time division of the job of encoding state for the network.  The following table presents the above tree of forks as a time-divided ledger.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>leader slot </th><th>  L1 </th><th> L2 </th><th> L3 </th><th> L4 </th><th> L5</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>data      </td><td>  E1</td><td> E2 </td><td> E3 </td><td> E4  </td><td> E5</td></tr>
<tr><td>ticks since prev  </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> x </td><td> xx</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Note that only data from leader <code>L3</code> will be accepted during leader slot
<code>L3</code>.  Data from <code>L3</code> may include &quot;catchup&quot; ticks back to a slot other than
<code>L2</code> if <code>L3</code> did not observe <code>L2</code>'s data.  <code>L4</code> and <code>L5</code>'s transmissions
include the &quot;ticks since prev&quot; PoH entries.</p>
<p>This arrangement of the network data streams permits nodes to save exactly this
to the ledger for replay, restart, and checkpoints.</p>
<a class="header" href="#leaders-view" id="leaders-view"><h4>Leader's View</h4></a>
<p>When a new leader begins a slot, it must first transmit any PoH (ticks)
required to link the new slot with the most recently observed and voted

<a class="header" href="#pipelining" id="pipelining"><h2>Pipelining</h2></a>
<p>The fullnodes make extensive use of an optimization common in CPU design,
called <em>pipelining</em>.  Pipelining is the right tool for the job when there's a
stream of input data that needs to be processed by a sequence of steps, and
there's different hardware responsible for each. The quintessential example is
using a washer and dryer to wash/dry/fold several loads of laundry. Washing
must occur before drying and drying before folding, but each of the three
operations is performed by a separate unit. To maximize efficiency, one creates
a pipeline of <em>stages</em>. We'll call the washer one stage, the dryer another, and
the folding process a third. To run the pipeline, one adds a second load of
laundry to the washer just after the first load is added to the dryer.
Likewise, the third load is added to the washer after the second is in the
dryer and the first is being folded. In this way, one can make progress on
three loads of laundry simultaneously. Given infinite loads, the pipeline will
consistently complete a load at the rate of the slowest stage in the pipeline.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pipelining-in-the-fullnode" id="pipelining-in-the-fullnode"><h2>Pipelining in the fullnode</h2></a>
<p>The fullnode contains two pipelined processes, one used in leader mode called
the Tpu and one used in validator mode called the Tvu. In both cases, the
hardware being pipelined is the same, the network input, the GPU cards, the CPU
cores, writes to disk, and the network output.  What it does with that hardware
is different.  The Tpu exists to create ledger entries whereas the Tvu exists
to validate them.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ">Avalance explainer video</a> is
a conceptual overview of how a Solana leader can continuously process a gigabit
of transaction data per second and then get that same data, after being
recorded on the ledger, out to multiple validators on a single gigabit
backplane.</p>
<p>In practice, we found that just one level of the Avalanche validator tree is
sufficient for at least 150 validators. We anticipate adding the second level
to solve one of two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>To transmit ledger segments to slower &quot;replicator&quot; nodes.</li>
<li>To scale up the number of validators nodes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both problems justify the additional level, but you won't find it implemented
in the reference design just yet, because Solana's gossip implementation is
currently the bottleneck on the number of nodes per Solana cluster.  That work
is being actively developed here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/1546">Scalable Gossip</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#storage" id="storage"><h1>Storage</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#background" id="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>
<p>At full capacity on a 1gbps network Solana would generate 4 petabytes of data
per year. If each fullnode was required to store the full ledger, the cost of
storage would discourage fullnode participation, thus centralizing the network
around those that could afford it. Solana aims to keep the cost of a fullnode
below $5,000 USD to maximize participation. To achieve that, the network needs
to minimize redundant storage while at the same time ensuring the validity and
availability of each copy.</p>
<p>To trust storage of ledger segments, Solana has <em>replicators</em> periodically
submit proofs to the network that the data was replicated. Each proof is called
a Proof of Replication.  The basic idea of it is to encrypt a dataset with a
public symmetric key and then hash the encrypted dataset. Solana uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Block_Chaining_(CBC)">CBC
encryption</a>.
To prevent a malicious replicator from deleting the data as soon as it's
hashed, a replicator is required hash random segments of the dataset.
Alternatively, Solana could require hashing the reverse of the encrypted data,
but random sampling is sufficient and much faster.  Either solution ensures
that all the data is present during the generation of the proof and also
requires the validator to have the entirety of the encrypted data present for
verification of every proof of every identity. The space required to validate
is:</p>
<p><code>number_of_proofs * data_size</code></p>
<a class="header" href="#optimization-with-poh" id="optimization-with-poh"><h1>Optimization with PoH</h1></a>
<p>Solana is not the only distribute systems project using Proof of Replication,
but it might be the most efficient implementation because of its ability to
synchronize nodes with its Proof of History. With PoH, Solana is able to record
a hash of the PoRep samples in the ledger.  Thus the blocks stay in the exact
same order for every PoRep and verification can stream the data and verify all
the proofs in a single batch.  This way Solana can verify multiple proofs
concurrently, each one on its own GPU core. With the current generation of
graphics cards our network can support up to 14,000 replication identities or
symmetric keys. The total space required for verification is:</p>
<p><code>2 CBC_blocks * number_of_identities</code></p>
<p>with core count of equal to (Number of Identities). A CBC block is expected to
be 1MB in size.</p>
<a class="header" href="#network" id="network"><h1>Network</h1></a>
<p>Validators for PoRep are the same validators that are verifying transactions.
They have some stake that they have put up as collateral that ensures that
their work is honest. If you can prove that a validator verified a fake PoRep,
then the validator's stake is slashed.</p>
<p>Replicators are specialized light clients. They download a part of the ledger
and store it and provide proofs of storing the ledger. For each verified proof,
replicators are rewarded tokens from the mining pool.</p>
<a class="header" href="#constraints" id="constraints"><h1>Constraints</h1></a>
<p>Solana's PoRep protocol instroduces the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>At most 14,000 replication identities can be used, because that is how many GPU
cores are currently available to a computer costing under $5,000 USD.</li>
<li>Verification requires generating the CBC blocks. That requires space of 2
blocks per identity, and 1 GPU core per identity for the same dataset. As
many identities at once are batched with as many proofs for those identities
verified concurrently for the same dataset.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#validation-and-replication-protocol" id="validation-and-replication-protocol"><h1>Validation and Replication Protocol</h1></a>
<ol>
<li>The network sets a replication target number, let's say 1k. 1k PoRep
identities are created from signatures of a PoH hash. They are tied to a
specific PoH hash. It doesn't matter who creates them, or it could simply be
the last 1k validation signatures we saw for the ledger at that count. This is
maybe just the initial batch of identities, because we want to stagger identity
rotation.</li>
<li>Any client can use any of these identities to create PoRep proofs.
Replicator identities are the CBC encryption keys.</li>
<li>Periodically at a specific PoH count, a replicator that wants to create
PoRep proofs signs the PoH hash at that count. That signature is the seed
used to pick the block and identity to replicate. A block is 1TB of ledger.</li>
<li>Periodically at a specific PoH count, a replicator submits PoRep proofs for
their selected block. A signature of the PoH hash at that count is the seed
used to sample the 1TB encrypted block, and hash it. This is done faster than
it takes to encrypt the 1TB block with the original identity.</li>
<li>Replicators must submit some number of fake proofs, which they can prove to
be fake by providing the seed for the hash result.</li>
<li>Periodically at a specific PoH count, validators sign the hash and use the
signature to select the 1TB block that they need to validate. They batch all
the identities and proofs and submit approval for all the verified ones.</li>
<li>After #6, replicator client submit the proofs of fake proofs.</li>
</ol>
<p>For any random seed, Solana requires everyone to use a signature that is
derived from a PoH hash. Every node uses the same count so that the same PoH
hash is signed by every participant. The signatures are then each
cryptographically tied to the keypair, which prevents a leader from grinding on
the resulting value for more than 1 identity.</p>
<p>Key rotation is <em>staggered</em>. Once going, the next identity is generated by
hashing itself with a PoH hash.</p>
<p>Since there are many more client identities then encryption identities, the
reward is split amont multiple clients to prevent Sybil attacks from generating
many clients to acquire the same block of data. To remain BFT, the network
needs to avoid a single human entity from storing all the replications of a
single chunk of the ledger.</p>
<p>Solana's solution to this is to require clients to continue using the same
identity. If the first round is used to acquire the same block for many client
identities, the second round for the same client identities will require a
redistribution of the signatures, and therefore PoRep identities and blocks.
Thus to get a reward for storage, clients are not rewarded for storage of the
first block. The network rewards long-lived client identities more than new
ones.</p>

<p>With the Solana runtime, we can execute on-chain programs concurrently, and
written in the client’s choice of programming language.</p>
<a class="header" href="#client-interactions-with-solana" id="client-interactions-with-solana"><h2>Client interactions with Solana</h2></a>
<p><img alt="SDK tools" src="img/sdk-tools.svg" class="center"/></p>
<p>As shown in the diagram above an untrusted client, creates a program in the
language of their choice, (i.e. C/C++/Rust/Lua), and compiles it with LLVM to a
position independent shared object ELF, targeting BPF bytecode, and sends it to
the Solana cluster. Next, the client sends messages to the Solana cluster,
which target that program. The Solana runtime loads the previously submitted
ELF and passes it the client's message for interpretation.</p>
<a class="header" href="#persistent-storage" id="persistent-storage"><h2>Persistent Storage</h2></a>
<p>Solana supports several kinds of persistent storage, called <em>accounts</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Executable</li>
<li>Writable by a client</li>
<li>Writable by a program</li>
<li>Read-only</li>
</ol>
<p>All accounts are identified by public keys and may hold arbirary data.
When the client sends messages to programs, it requests access to storage
using those keys. The runtime loads the account data and passes it to the
program. The runtime also ensures accounts aren't written to if not owned
by the client or program. Any writes to read-only accounts are discarded
unless the write was to credit tokens. Any user may credit other accounts
tokens, regardless of account permission.</p>
<a class="header" href="#runtime" id="runtime"><h1>Runtime</h1></a>
<p>The goal with the runtime is to have a general purpose execution environment
that is highly parallelizable.  To achieve this goal the runtime forces each
Instruction to specify all of its memory dependencies up front, and therefore a
single Instruction cannot cause a dynamic memory allocation.  An explicit
Instruction for memory allocation from the <code>SystemProgram::CreateAccount</code> is
the only way to allocate new memory in the engine.  A Transaction may compose
multiple Instruction, including <code>SystemProgram::CreateAccount</code>, into a single
atomic sequence which allows for memory allocation to achieve a result that is
similar to dynamic allocation.</p>
<a class="header" href="#state" id="state"><h3>State</h3></a>
<p>State is addressed by an Account which is at the moment simply the Pubkey.  Our
goal is to eliminate memory allocation from within the program itself.  Thus
the client of the program provides all the state that is necessary for the
program to execute in the transaction itself.  The runtime interacts with the
program through an entry point with a well defined interface.  The userdata
stored in an Account is an opaque type to the runtime, a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>, the
contents of which the program code has full control over.</p>
<p>The Transaction structure specifies a list of Pubkey's and signatures for those
keys and a sequential list of instructions that will operate over the state's
associated with the <code>account_keys</code>.  For the transaction to be committed all
the instructions must execute successfully, if any abort the whole transaction
fails to commit.</p>

<a class="header" href="#transaction-engine" id="transaction-engine"><h1>Transaction Engine</h1></a>

<p>At the <code>execute</code> stage, the loaded pages have no data dependencies, so all the
programs can be executed in parallel.</p>
<p>The runtime enforces the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>program_id</code> code is the only code that will modify the contents of
<code>Account::userdata</code> of Account's that have been assigned to it.  This means
that upon assignment userdata vector is guaranteed to be <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Total balances on all the accounts is equal before and after execution of a
Transaction.</li>
<li>Balances of each of the accounts not assigned to <code>program_id</code> must be equal
to or greater after the Transaction than before the transaction.</li>
<li>All Instructions in the Transaction executed without a failure.</li>

<li><code>Assign</code> - allows the user to assign an existing account to a <code>Program</code>.</li>
<li><code>Move</code>  - moves tokens between <code>Account</code>s that are associated with

<a class="header" href="#notes" id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2></a>

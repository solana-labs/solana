## getBlock

Returns identity and transaction information about a confirmed block in the ledger

<DocSideBySide>

<CodeParams>

### Parameters:

<Parameter type={"u64"} required={true}>
  slot number, as <code>u64</code> integer
</Parameter>

<Parameter type={"object"} optional={true}> 
Configuration object containing the following fields:

<Field
  name="commitment"
  type="string"
  optional={true}
  defaultValue={"finalized"}
  href="/api#configuring-state-commitment"
>
  <li>
    the default is <code>finalized</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>processed</code> is not supported.
  </li>
</Field>

<Field name="encoding" type="string" optional={true} defaultValue={"json"} href="/api#parsed-responses">

encoding format for each returned Transaction

<Values values={["json", "jsonParsed", "base58", "base64"]} />

<details>

- `jsonParsed` attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return
  more human-readable and explicit data in the `transaction.message.instructions` list.
- If `jsonParsed` is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction
  falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex` fields).

</details>

</Field>

<Field name="transactionDetails" type="string" optional={true} defaultValue={"full"}>
  
level of transaction detail to return
  
<Values values={["full", "accounts", "signatures", "none"]} />

<details>

- If `accounts` are requested, transaction details only include signatures and
  an annotated list of accounts in each transaction.
- Transaction metadata is limited to only: fee, err, pre_balances,
  post_balances, pre_token_balances, and post_token_balances.

</details>

</Field>

<Field name="maxSupportedTransactionVersion" type="number" optional={true}>
  
the max transaction version to return in responses.

<details>

- If the requested block contains a transaction with a higher version, an
  error will be returned.
- If this parameter is omitted, only legacy transactions will be returned, and
  a block containing any versioned transaction will prompt the error.

</details>

</Field>

<Field name="rewards" type="bool" optional={true}>
  whether to populate the `rewards` array. If parameter not provided, the
  default includes rewards.
</Field>

</Parameter>

#### Transaction Structure

Transactions are quite different from those on other blockchains. Be sure to review [Anatomy of a Transaction](developing/programming-model/transactions.md) to learn about transactions on Solana.

The JSON structure of a transaction is defined as follows:

- `signatures: <array[string]>` - A list of base-58 encoded signatures applied to the transaction. The list is always of length `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` and not empty. The signature at index `i` corresponds to the public key at index `i` in `message.accountKeys`. The first one is used as the [transaction id](../../terminology.md#transaction-id).
- `message: <object>` - Defines the content of the transaction.
  - `accountKeys: <array[string]>` - List of base-58 encoded public keys used by the transaction, including by the instructions and for signatures. The first `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` public keys must sign the transaction.
  - `header: <object>` - Details the account types and signatures required by the transaction.
    - `numRequiredSignatures: <number>` - The total number of signatures required to make the transaction valid. The signatures must match the first `numRequiredSignatures` of `message.accountKeys`.
    - `numReadonlySignedAccounts: <number>` - The last `numReadonlySignedAccounts` of the signed keys are read-only accounts. Programs may process multiple transactions that load read-only accounts within a single PoH entry, but are not permitted to credit or debit lamports or modify account data. Transactions targeting the same read-write account are evaluated sequentially.
    - `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts: <number>` - The last `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts` of the unsigned keys are read-only accounts.
  - `recentBlockhash: <string>` - A base-58 encoded hash of a recent block in the ledger used to prevent transaction duplication and to give transactions lifetimes.
  - `instructions: <array[object]>` - List of program instructions that will be executed in sequence and committed in one atomic transaction if all succeed.
    - `programIdIndex: <number>` - Index into the `message.accountKeys` array indicating the program account that executes this instruction.
    - `accounts: <array[number]>` - List of ordered indices into the `message.accountKeys` array indicating which accounts to pass to the program.
    - `data: <string>` - The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.
  - `addressTableLookups: <array[object]|undefined>` - List of address table lookups used by a transaction to dynamically load addresses from on-chain address lookup tables. Undefined if `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` is not set.
    - `accountKey: <string>` - base-58 encoded public key for an address lookup table account.
    - `writableIndexes: <array[number]>` - List of indices used to load addresses of writable accounts from a lookup table.
    - `readonlyIndexes: <array[number]>` - List of indices used to load addresses of readonly accounts from a lookup table.

#### Inner Instructions Structure

The Solana runtime records the cross-program instructions that are invoked during transaction processing and makes these available for greater transparency of what was executed on-chain per transaction instruction. Invoked instructions are grouped by the originating transaction instruction and are listed in order of processing.

The JSON structure of inner instructions is defined as a list of objects in the following structure:

- `index: number` - Index of the transaction instruction from which the inner instruction(s) originated
- `instructions: <array[object]>` - Ordered list of inner program instructions that were invoked during a single transaction instruction.
  - `programIdIndex: <number>` - Index into the `message.accountKeys` array indicating the program account that executes this instruction.
  - `accounts: <array[number]>` - List of ordered indices into the `message.accountKeys` array indicating which accounts to pass to the program.
  - `data: <string>` - The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.

#### Token Balances Structure

The JSON structure of token balances is defined as a list of objects in the following structure:

- `accountIndex: <number>` - Index of the account in which the token balance is provided for.
- `mint: <string>` - Pubkey of the token's mint.
- `owner: <string|undefined>` - Pubkey of token balance's owner.
- `programId: <string|undefined>` - Pubkey of the Token program that owns the account.
- `uiTokenAmount: <object>` -
  - `amount: <string>` - Raw amount of tokens as a string, ignoring decimals.
  - `decimals: <number>` - Number of decimals configured for token's mint.
  - `uiAmount: <number|null>` - Token amount as a float, accounting for decimals. **DEPRECATED**
  - `uiAmountString: <string>` - Token amount as a string, accounting for decimals.

## Download Prebuilt Binaries

If you would rather not use `solana-install` to manage the install, you can
manually download and install the binaries.

### Linux

Download the binaries by navigating to
[https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest),
download **solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2**, then extract the
archive:

```bash
tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
cd solana-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

### MacOS

Download the binaries by navigating to
[https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest),
download **solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2**, then extract the
archive:

```bash
tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
cd solana-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

### Windows

- Download the binaries by navigating to
  [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest),
  download **solana-release-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.bz2**, then extract the
  archive using WinZip or similar.

- Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory into which you extracted
  the binaries and run:

```bash
cd solana-release/
set PATH=%cd%/bin;%PATH%
```

## Build From Source

If you are unable to use the prebuilt binaries or prefer to build it yourself
from source, navigate to
[https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest),
and download the **Source Code** archive. Extract the code and build the
binaries with:

```bash
./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

You can then run the following command to obtain the same result as with
prebuilt binaries:

```bash
solana-install init
```

## Use Homebrew

This option requires you to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager on your MacOS or Linux machine.

### MacOS & Linux

- Follow instructions at: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/solana

[Homebrew formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/solana.rb)
is updated after each `solana` release, however it is possible that
the Homebrew version is outdated.

- Confirm you have the desired version of `solana` installed by entering:

```bash
solana --version
```

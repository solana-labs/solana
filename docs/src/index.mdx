# Solana Documentation

Solana is a blockchain built for mass adoption. It's a high performance network
that is utilized for a range of use cases, including finance, NFTs, payments,
and gaming. Solana operates as a single global state machine, and is open,
interoperable and decentralized.

## Getting started

Dive right into Solana to start building or setup your tooling.

- [Setup local environment](/cli) - Install the Solana CLI to get your local
  development environment setup
- [Hello World in your browser](getstarted/hello-world) - Build and deploy your
  first on-chain Solana program, directly in your browser using Solana
  Playground

## Start learning

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Solana different
from other blockchains.

- [Transactions](./developing/programming-model/transactions) - Collection of
  instructions for the blockchain to execute
- [Accounts](./developing/programming-model/accounts) - Data and state storage
  mechanism for Solana
- [Programs](./developing/intro/programs) - The executable code used to perform
  actions on the blockchain
- [Cross-Program Invocation](./developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs) -
  Core of the "composability" of Solana, this is how programs can "call" each
  other.

## Understanding the architecture

Get to know the underlying architecture of how the proof-of-stake blockchain
works.

- [Validators](./validator/anatomy) - the individual nodes that are the backbone
  of the network
- [Clusters](./cluster/overview) - a collection of validators that work together
  for consensus

## Running a validator

Explore what it takes to operate a Solana validator and help secure the network.

- [System requirements](./running-validator/validator-reqs) - Recommended
  hardware requirements and expected SOL needed to operate a validator
- [Quick start guide](./validator/get-started/setup-a-validator) - Setup a
  validator and get connected to a cluster for the first time

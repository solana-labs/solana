title: Support / Troubleshooting
---

If you have questions or are having trouble setting up or using your wallet
of choice, please make sure you've read through all the relevant pages in our
[Wallet Guide](paper-wallet.md). The Solana team is working hard to support new
features on popular wallets, and we do our best to keep our documents up to date
with the latest available features.

If you have questions after reading the docs, feel free to reach out to us on
our [Telegram](https://t.me/solana).

For **technical support**, please ask a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/solana) and tag your questions with `solana`.

        Steps to add a new feature are outlined below. Note that these steps only cover
        the process of getting a feature into the core Solana code.

        - For features that are unambiguously good (ie bug fixes), these steps are sufficient.

        - For features that should go up for community vote (ie fee structure changes), more
        information on the additional steps to follow can be found at:
        <https://spl.solana.com/feature-proposal#feature-proposal-life-cycle>

        1. Generate a new keypair with `solana-keygen new --outfile feature.json --no-passphrase`
            - Keypairs should be held by core contributors only. If you're a non-core contirbutor going
            through these steps, the PR process will facilitate a keypair holder being picked. That
            person will generate the keypair, provide pubkey for PR, and ultimately enable the feature.

        2. Add a public module for the feature, specifying keypair pubkey as the id with
        `solana_sdk::declare_id!()` within the module. Additionally, add an entry to `FEATURE_NAMES` map.

        3. Add desired logic to check for and switch on feature availability.

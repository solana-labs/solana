      Hi @{issue-author},


      Thanks for your question!


      We want to make sure to keep signal strong in the GitHub issue tracker &ndash; to make sure
      that it remains the best place to track issues that affect the development of Solana itself.


      Questions like yours deserve a purpose-built Q&A forum. Unless there exists evidence that
      this is a bug with Solana itself, please post your question to the Solana Stack Exchange
      using this link: https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/ask
